        As early as the sixteenth century, Germans played a bluffing game called
        "Pochen." It later developed into a French version, called "Poque,"
        which was eventually brought over to New Orleans and played on the
        riverboats that plied the Mississippi.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the 1830s, the game was refined further and became known as Poker.
        During the Civil War, the key rule about drawing cards to improve one's
        hand was added. A variation - Stud Poker - appeared at about the same
        time. There are hundreds of versions of Poker, and the game is played
        not only in private homes, but also in countless Poker rooms at famous
        casinos. Poker can be played socially for pennies or matchsticks, or
        professionally for thousands of dollars.
        <br />
        <br />
        There is plenty of luck in Poker, but the game requires incredibly great
        skill as well, and each player is the master of his own fate.

      <h3 class="firstPageH3">The Pack</h3>
      <p class="firstPageP">
        The standard 52-card pack, sometimes with the addition of one or two
        jokers, is used. Poker is a one-pack game, but today, in virtually all
        games played in clubs and among the best players, two packs of
        contrasting colors are utilized in order to speed up the game. While one
        pack is being dealt, the other is being shuffled and prepared for the
        next deal. The procedure for two packs is as follows: While the deal is
        in progress, the previous dealer assembles all the cards from the pack
        he dealt, shuffles them, and places them to the left. When it is time
        for the next deal, the shuffled deck is passed to the next dealer. In
        many games in which two packs are used, the dealer's left-hand opponent,
        instead of the right-hand opponent, cuts the pack.
        <br />
        <br />

        In clubs, it is customary to change cards often and to permit any player
        to call for new cards whenever they wish. When new cards are introduced,
        both packs are replaced, and the seal and cellophane wrapping on the new
        decks should be broken in full view of all the players.

      <h3 class="firstPageH3">Card Values/scoring</h3>
      <p class="firstPageP">
        While Poker is played in innumerable forms, a player who understands the
        values of the Poker hands and the principles of betting can play without
        difficulty in any type of Poker game. Except in a few versions of the
        game, a Poker hand consists of five cards. The various combinations of
        Poker hands rank from five of a kind (the highest) to no pair or nothing
        (the lowest):
        <br />
        <br />

        Five of a Kind – This is the highest possible hand and can occur only in
        games where at least one card is wild, such as a joker, the two one-eyed
        jacks, or the four deuces. Examples of five of a kind would be four 10s
        and a wild card or two queens and three wild cards.
        <br />
        <br />
        Straight Flush – This is the highest possible hand when only the
        standard pack is used, and there are no wild cards. A straight flush
        consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10, 9, 8,
        7, 6 of hearts. The highest-ranking straight flush is the A, K, Q, J,
        and 10 of one suit, and this combination has a special name: a royal
        flush or a royal straight flush. The odds on being dealt this hand are 1
        in almost 650,000.
        <br />
        <br />
        Four of a Kind – This is the next highest hand, and it ranks just below
        a straight flush. An example is four aces or four 3s. It does not matter
        what the fifth, unmatched card is.
        <br />
        <br />
        Full House – This colorful hand is made up of three cards of one rank
        and two cards of another rank, such as three 8s and two 4s, or three
        aces and two 6s.
        <br />
        <br />
        Flush – Five cards, all of the same suit, but not all in sequence, is a
        flush. An example is Q, 10, 7, 6, and 2 of clubs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Straight – Five cards in sequence, but not all of the same suit is a
        straight. An example is 9♥, 8♣, 7♠, 6♦, 5♥.
        <br />
        <br />
        Three of a Kind – This combination contains three cards of the same
        rank, and the other two cards each of a different rank, such as three
        jacks, a seven, and a four.
        <br />
        <br />
        Two Pairs – This hand contains a pair of one rank and another pair of a
        different rank, plus any fifth card of a different rank, such as Q, Q,
        7, 7, 4.
        <br />
        <br />
        One Pair – This frequent combination contains just one pair with the
        other three cards being of different rank. An example is 10, 10, K, 4,
        3.
        <br />
        <br />
        No Pair – This very common hand contains "nothing." None of the five
        cards pair up, nor are all five cards of the same suit or consecutive in
        rank. When more than one player has no pair, the hands are rated by the
        highest card each hand contains, so that an ace-high hand beats a
        king-high hand, and so on.
        <br />
        <br />
        Two hands that are identical, card for card, are tied since the suits
        have no relative rank in Poker. In such a case, the tied players split
        the pot. Note that if two hands contain the same high pair, then the
        ranking of the next card in the hands determines which one wins. For
        example: 9, 9, 7, 4, 2 beats 9, 9, 5, 3, 2. Likewise, two hands that
        have identical pairs would be decided by the fifth card. For example: Q,
        Q, 6, 6, J beats Q, Q, 6, 6, 10.

      <h3 class="firstPageH3">Betting</h3>
      <p class="firstPageP">
        Betting is the key to Poker, for the game, in essence, is a game of chip
        management.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        In the course of each Poker deal, there will be one or more betting
        intervals in which the players have an opportunity to bet on their
        hands. Minimizing losses with poor hands and maximizing winnings with
        good hands is the underlying skill that Poker requires.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before the cards are even dealt, the rules of the Poker game being
        played may require that each player put an initial contribution, called
        an "ante," of one or more chips into the pot, to start it off.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each betting interval, or round, begins when a player, in turn, makes a
        bet of one or more chips. Each player to the left, in turn, must either
        "call" that bet by putting into the pot the same number of chips; or
        "raise," which means that the player puts in more than enough chips to
        call; or "drop" ("fold"), which means that the player puts no chips in
        the pot, discards their hand, and is out of the betting until the next
        deal.
        <br />
        <br />
        When a player drops, they lose any chips that have put into that pot.
        Unless a player is willing to put into the pot at least as many chips as
        any preceding player, they must drop out.
        <br />
        <br />
        A betting interval ends when the bets have been equalized - that is,
        when each player has either put in exactly as many chips as their
        predecessors or has dropped. There are usually two or more betting
        intervals for each Poker deal. After the final interval there is a
        "showdown," which means that each player who remains shows their hand
        face up on the table. The best Poker hand then takes the pot.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a player makes a bet or a raise that no other player calls, they win
        the pot without showing their hand. Thus, in Poker, there is a bluffing
        element, and the best combination of cards does not always win the pot!
        Bluffing is one of the key reasons why Poker is so popular.
        <br />
        <br />
        If a player wishes to remain in the game without betting, they "check."
        This means, in effect, that the player is making a "bet of nothing." A
        player may check provided no one before them in that betting interval
        has made a bet. If another player has bet, they cannot check but must at
        least call the bet or drop. A player who checks may raise a bet that has
        been raised by another player. This is called "sandbagging," which is
        allowed, unless it has been decided beforehand that this practice is
        forbidden. If all players check during a round of play, the betting
        interval is over, and all the players still in the pot remain in the
        game.
        <br />
        <br />
        In each betting round, one player is designated as the first bettor,
        according to the rules of the game. The turn to bet always moves to the
        left, from player to player, and no one may check, bet, or even drop,
        except when it is their turn.
        <br />
        <br />
        Knowing When to Bet The ranking of Poker hands is based on mathematics.
        The less likely a player is to get a certain hand, the higher it ranks
        and the more likely it is to win the pot. For example, a player should
        not expect to be dealt a straight flush more than once in 65,000 hands,
        but they can expect to be dealt two pair about once in every 21 hands.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unless a player is planning to bluff, they should not make a bet without
        holding a hand that they think may be the best. No Poker player can bet
        intelligently unless they know what constitutes a good hand, a fair
        hand, and a bad hand. A table of the various Poker hands and the number
        of combinations of each in a pack of cards is provided.
